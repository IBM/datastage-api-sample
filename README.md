# InfoSphere DataStage API Sample

This is an updated dsjob.exe sample program demonstrating how to use the DataStage API from C/C++ on Windows.  Originally published in the Server Job Developer's Guide by Ascential Software Corporation prior to acquisition by IBM. Updates include changes to compile without warnings, and support added for domain authentication.

This is not a replacement for dsjob provided by DataStage, it is purely an example and lacks most features of the complete implementation.

It can be built using Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 or above.  You may need to edit or override \<ISHomeDir\> in [BuildSettings.props](BuildSettings.props) to match your InformationServer installation location if different from the default C:\IBM\InformationServer.

For usage, run without any arguments.
