# DataStage API Sample

This is an updated dsjob.exe sample program demonstrating how to use the DataStage API from C/C++ on Windows.  Originally published in the Server Job Developer's Guide by Ascential Software Corporation prior to acquisition by IBM.

This is not a replacement for dsjob provided by DataStage, it is purely an example and lacks most features of the full implementation.

It can be built using Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 or above.  You may need to edit or override \<ISHomeDir\> in [BuildSettings.props](BuildSettings.props) to match your InformationServer installation location.

For usage, run without any arguments.
